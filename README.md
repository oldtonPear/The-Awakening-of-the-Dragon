Use 'a' to move left and 'd' to move right
Press 'space' to shoot
Press 'enter' to execute the super attack
There is a total of 8 levels and every time you win you can proceed to the next one.
The goal of this game is to take down every plane in order to be able to fly free again.
Once a plane goes under the screen, it will soon respawn back to the top but there is a catch:
if you let too many planes pass, you will find some trouble later because there will be more planes.
