# The Awakening of the Dragon
An ancient dragon awakens at modern ages and the governments decides to take it down.
Use 'a' to move left and 'd' to move right
Press 'space' to shoot
Press 'enter' to execute the super attack
There is a total of 8 levels and every time you win you can proceed to the next one.
The goal of this game is to take down every plane for the freedom of flying free again.
Once a plane goes under the screen, it will soon respawn back to the top but there is a catch:
if you let too many planes go under the screen, you will find some trouble later because there will be more planes coming down for you.

Collisions: 
 Plane -> insta-kill.
 Stealth-plane-bullet -> 1 hearth.
 War-plane-bullt -> 2 hearths.
 
Have fun with my game!
If you have any suggestions feel free to pull on this GitHub and i'll review all the changes.
